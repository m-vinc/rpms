## Why?  

Iâ€™m learning how to package software â€” thatâ€™s the main goal.  

Iâ€™m tired of everything being "packaged" using Docker and Dockerfiles. I used to be one of those people who relied on Docker for "packaging" services in my homelab. But lately, Iâ€™ve started migrating some services from Podman/Docker to Proxmox containers (LXC), where I need to install services using something revolutionary: the operating systemâ€™s package manager.  

Do I enjoy it? Probably. The more I do it, the more I appreciate it â€” and the more I grow frustrated with the typical new project on Git{Hub,GitLab} that lacks proper packaging. Instead, thereâ€™s usually just a Dockerfile containing the entire earth (and if youâ€™re lucky, some multi-stage build with nested images dependencies).  

Letâ€™s be honest: many people create Docker images by installing packages via a package manager *inside* the image. So why not package the software first and then build a Docker image from it?

## No Hate, Just Learning  

Thereâ€™s no real hate behind this. Iâ€™m just using it as an excuse to learn something new! ðŸ˜„
